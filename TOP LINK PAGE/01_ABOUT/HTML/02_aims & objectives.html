        <div>
            <div>
                <h3>Engaging Minds</h3>
                <p>The School's curriculum and teaching methodology has been designed in a very practical and
                    learner-centric manner. Students are encouraged to think creatively and acquire knowledge through
                    innovative ways that test their analytical and problem-solving skills.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Touching Heart</h3>
                <p>FPS understands that each student has different interests and abilities. Our faculties extend a
                    helping hand to bring out the greatest potential of each student and sensitise them to society
                    issues related to the environment, peace, poverty, conflict resolution and so on.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Dignity in Action</h3>
                <p>While the students are prepared for the competitive and tough arena through a constructive learning
                    process, they are also taught that winning is not everything in life. Sound moral values are
                    inculcated in each student with the objective of grooming responsible and dignified and noble
                    citizen.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Sense of Enterprise</h3>
                <p>The entire curriculum has been designed to impart education with a perspective which inspires the
                    students to broaden their horizon and think big.</p>
