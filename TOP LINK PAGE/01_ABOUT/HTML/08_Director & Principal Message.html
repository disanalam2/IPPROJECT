            <h2>PRINCIPAL MESSAGE</h2>
            <p><strong>“The purpose of education is to turn mirrors into windows”</strong></p>
            <p>India is at the forefront of the global revolution and Education plays a key role in shaping the same. Gone are the days of the “Chalk and Talk” methodology and the impetus is on experiential learning and the mantra of Child centric education. Committed to this purpose, is Firayalal Public School, Ranchi. It understands the unique learning potential of every child and has geared its Learning System to provide students with a better understanding of life skills and values.</p>
            <p>Shaping young minds is one of the most challenging as well as interesting tasks in the present times. Just a glimpse of the bright, sparkling eyes is enough to bring a smile to our faces. We wonder how we can help these young flowers bloom in this world without ever robbing them of their smiles and we constantly seek newer ways to ensure it.</p>
            <p>We at Firayalal Public School, Ranchi resonate to our tag line “Attain and Excel” and our young scholars are stimulated to explore their innate talents. With this as an invocation and a commitment, we, caretakers, facilitators and essentially all of us co- learners, welcome you to this mindful laboratory of learning- a universe that pulsates with the dreams and aspirations of each aspirant who is or aspires to be the new Gandhi, Ramanujam, Aryabhatta, Michael Angelo, CV Raman, Bismillah Khan, Satyajit Ray, Florence Nightingale Pele, Laxmibai, Meera, Kalam, Rahman, Spielberg or for that matter a student of FPS , Ranchi to make a difference to the world we live in, now and beyond!</p>
            <p>Each child’s future follows a different path and momentum. In order for them to succeed in the 21st century, we will need to provide them with an education that prepares them to be creative, compassionate and innovative adults. We as responsible educators take upon ourselves to create a stimulating environment where young minds are nurtured to blossom into intelligent, mature and enriched youth. Knowledge being the most democratic source of power, we must impart quality education to our young scholars who are key agents in the process of development and peace. We at Firayalal Public School, Ranchi are committed towards preparing skilled, knowledgeable, holistically developed personalities who continue to inspire our future generations and make us proud by their commendable contribution to the industry and society.</p>
